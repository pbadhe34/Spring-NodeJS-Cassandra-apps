To Check the status of the Cassandra nodes in your cluster - Go to the /<Install_Dir>/apache-cassandra/bin/ directory and type the command as 
 ./nodetool status    
If the status for all the nodes shows as UN , then the nodes are up and running. If the status for any node shows as DN , then that particular node is down.
When a node is down, it usually means that the node did not start properly. It can take several minutes for the node to start. Ensure the node is running or there are no network problems preventing the node from communicating with other nodes in the cluster. Run ./nodetool status again in a few minutes until the node is in UN status.

On Unix/linux the cassnadra can be configured to run as service.

Verify Cassandra log files - Go to /<Install_Dir>/apache-cassandra/logs/system.log.
